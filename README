Thep purpose of this repository is to catalog and make available any code that I make for either personal projects, or academic purposes.

Feel free to ask any questions about any code!
Keep in mind, im just an meceng student, so my code can often be buggy and overall no the most eficient. So I strongly encourage you to make your own modifications as you see fit.
